# User Behavior and Profitability Analysis

## Project Description

This project is focused on analyzing user behavior and subscription profitability based on user activity on a website. The core objective is to explore how subscription types, geographic location, and engagement affect business metrics such as revenue and conversion.

I completed using Google Sheets to integrate multiple CSV datasets, create pivot tables, perform lookups, and build an interactive dashboard.

## Data Overview

The project uses three CSV files:

- `Users.csv` â€” User info (country, subscription type)
- `Subscriptions.csv` â€” Monthly fees per plan
- `Activity.csv` â€” Time spent, pageviews, conversions

### Key Fields:
- `User_ID`, `User_Name`: User identification  
- `Country`: User location  
- `Subscription_Type`: Subscription plan (Free, Basic, Premium)  
- `Monthly_Fee`: Price of subscription  
- `Pages_Viewed`, `Time_Spent_Minutes`: Engagement metrics  
- `Conversion`: Whether the user made a purchase  

### Data downloaded:  
From task-provided local files (CSV)

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Integration**  
   - Loaded 3 CSVs into separate sheets: Users, Subscriptions, Activity  
   - Used `VLOOKUP` to enrich user and activity data with monthly fees

2. **Behavior Analysis**  
   - Created multiple pivot tables to analyze:
     - Average session time by country and subscription
     - Revenue distribution by subscription type and country
     - Conversion rate by plan

3. **User Segmentation & Ranking**  
   - Identified top 5 most active users by pageviews using custom row index

4. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard:
     - Filters: by country and monthly fee
     - Summary cards: Total Revenue, Avg. Session Time, Total Users
     - Charts: Revenue distribution across countries
     - Pivot Tables: Subscription revenue, time spent

## Key Findings

### Insights:
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Germany**, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º **Australia**, and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ **India** generate the highest revenue:  
  $26,310, $23,680, and $21,990 respectively.
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **UK** shows the lowest revenue among large markets ($19,100),  
  which may indicate lower user engagement or a higher share of free-tier users.
- **Premium** subscriptions bring the highest revenue ($102,180),  
  while **Basic** subscriptions contribute significantly less ($31,080).
- Average time spent on site is nearly the same (~500 min) across all subscription tiers,  
  suggesting similar engagement levels regardless of plan.
- Minor differences across countries may be influenced by cultural habits or market-specific content.

### Recommendations:
- Increase share of Premium users â€” introduce targeted upsell offers for Free & Basic tiers.
- Improve monetization strategies in low-performing markets (e.g., UK) via tailored campaigns.
- Analyze UX/UI & content quality to maximize user engagement time.
- Implement personalized recommendations and features for Premium users to boost retention.
